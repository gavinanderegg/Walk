# Walk Demo

This is a small Google Maps app I made during an event at MT&L to promote healthier communting. Every employee was given a pedometer, and we counted our steps over a few months in 2011. We didn't quite make our goal of crossing the country and back, but we came pretty close! This app helped spur us along, and gave a general impression of how much we were walking week to week.
